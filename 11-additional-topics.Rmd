```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Avoid making commits with lots changes
- Do not commit changes to many files with a single commit message such as "Edits"!  
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github-desktop-select-lines.png")
```  
- Note that in a commit we can see the added lines - green highlight with `+` prefix - and deleted lines - red highligh with `-` prefix  
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/changes-in-a-commit.png")
```  

## Writing good commit messages
- Follow the **standard** recommendations about making commit messages, see
  - [here](https://style.tidyverse.org/gitgithub.html) and
  - [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

## Files for Git to ignore

- You should not commit all files in the folder on your computer into your repo
- The `.gitignore` file is a list of files and folders in your repo for Git to ignore
- Common files to ignore are
  - `.Rhistory`
  - `.DS_Store`
  - if using an RStudio project ignore the `.Rproj.user` directory with syntax `.Rproj.user/`

## GitHub repos contain more than just code
- A repo for an R package will probably contain
  - The code for the R package
  - The code for its website (often made with pkgdown and hosted with GitHub Pages or Netlify)  
    ```{r, out.width = "90%"}
    knitr::include_graphics("img/bpbounds-with-explanation.png")
    ```  
  - Scripts for controlling continuous integration services such as GitHub Actions
