# Merging a branch locally

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center")
```

- A PR is essentially doing a merge on GitHub, you can merge branches locally as well
- Say we created a new branch `edit-readme` and made a commit on it
- To merge `edit-readme` into `main` switch to `main`  
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/merge-into-current-branch.png")
  ```  
- Select `edit-readme` and click "Create a merge commit"
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/create-merge-commit.png")
  ``` 
- Then push the new commits onto `main` upto GitHub (when appropriate)
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/post-merge-push-origin.png")
  ```  
- Then you can delete the `edit-readme` branch  
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/post-merge-delete-branch.png")
  ```  
- Confirm the deletion
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/confirm-delete-branch.png")
  ```
