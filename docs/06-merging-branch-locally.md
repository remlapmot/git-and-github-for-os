# Merging a branch locally



- A PR is essentially doing a merge on GitHub, you can merge branches locally as well
- Say we created a new branch `edit-readme` and made a commit on it
- To merge `edit-readme` into `main` switch to `main`  
<img src="img/merge-into-current-branch.png" width="958" />
- Select `edit-readme` and click "Create a merge commit"
<img src="img/create-merge-commit.png" width="959" />
- Then push the new commits onto `main` upto GitHub (when appropriate)
<img src="img/post-merge-push-origin.png" width="959" />
- Then you can delete the `edit-readme` branch  
<img src="img/post-merge-delete-branch.png" width="960" />
- Confirm the deletion
