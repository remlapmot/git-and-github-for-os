# Merging a branch locally



- A PR is essentially doing a merge on GitHub, you can merge branches locally as well
- Say we created a new branch `edit-readme` and made a commit on it
- To merge `edit-readme` into `main` switch to `main`  
![](img/merge-into-current-branch.png)<!-- -->
- Select `edit-readme` and click "Create a merge commit"
![](img/create-merge-commit.png)<!-- -->
- Then push the new commits onto `main` upto GitHub (when appropriate)
![](img/post-merge-push-origin.png)<!-- -->
- Then you can delete the `edit-readme` branch

- Confirm the deletion
