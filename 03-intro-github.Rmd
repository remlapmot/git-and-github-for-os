# Intro to GitHub

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center")
```

- GitHub is a Git web server, there are others e.g., [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- Your repositories will be stored on GitHub, and you will clone them to your machine to work on them (or work on them in Gitpod)
- Under your user account you see the repos you are owner of

- On GitHub OpenSAFELY is an organization
  - The repos are owned by the organization so they are under the organisation [here](https://github.com/opensafely)
    ```{r}
    knitr::include_graphics("img/os-github-org.png")
    ```  

## GitHub PAT for R

- To create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to be allowed more downloads from GitHub per hour run in R  
  ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
  install.packages("usethis")
  library(usethis)
  create_github_token()
  ```

## GitHub CLI

- GitHub CLI stands for command line interface for operating GitHub
- Installation instructions are [here](https://github.com/cli/cli#readme)
- But I don't recommend using this
