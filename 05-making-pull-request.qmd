# Making a pull request

## Making a pull request

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center")
```

- Let's start by creating a new branch  
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/pr-new-branch.png")
  ```  
- We do some work (in VSCode/text editor/RStudio) which creates a markdown file with a title and some text. We then make a new commit which adds this new file to the repo
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/pr-commit-new-file.png")
  ```  
- Next publish the new branch to GitHub  
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/pr-publish-branch.png")
  ```  
- Now initiate the creation of the PR by either clicking in GitHub Desktop "Create Pull Request" 
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/pr-create-pr-01.png")
  ```  
- or clicking on the button on the repo webpage "Compare & pull request"  
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/pr-create-pr-02.png")
  ```  
- Edit the title box, add some extra text in the comment box, select a reviewer, and then click "Create pull request"  
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/pr-create-pr-and-reviewers.png")
  ```  
- You can amend/edit pull requests by modifying/adding commits to the branch from which you sent the PR
- See more about pull request reviews [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews)
- (The reviewer) will then merge your PR  
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/pr-merge-pr.png")
  ```  
- (The reviewer) will then confirm the merge  
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/pr-confirm-merge.png")
  ```  
- (Optional) Delete the branch the PR came from  
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/pr-delete-branch.png")
  ```  
- The PR is now finished and we can see the merge commit in the default (`main`/`master`) branch
  ```{r}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/pr-finished.png")
  ```  
- In GitHub Desktop click "Fetch origin"/"Pull origin" to pull the updated `main`/`master` branch down to your local machine ... and the process begins again ...
