# Short practical

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center")
```

1. On GitHub: 
    a. Go to our test repo (in our test organization) [here](https://github.com/tp-test-org/test)  
    
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tp-test-org-test.png")
```  
 b. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. In GitHub Desktop: make a new branch and switch to it
3. In any text editor: 
    a. Create a new markdown file called `yourfirstname-yourlastname.md`
    a. Add a sentence or two to the file about yourself, e.g.,
```{r, out.width = "65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tom-palmer-md.png")
```  
 c. Save this file into the (top level of the) repo
4. In GitHub Desktop: Commit this new file into your new branch
5. In GitHub Desktop: Push your new branch upto GitHub
6. On GitHub: Open a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch in which you select a reviewer (Tom/Venexia/Elsie) 
7. In your text editor and GitHub Desktop: Make any changes requested by the reviewer and add these to your PR - hopefully your pull request will then be merged by the reviewer!
8. On GitHub: Delete the branch you made your pull request from
9. In GitHub Desktop: Pull down the updated master branch to your machine ... in a real workflow you would then make another new branch and do more work...
